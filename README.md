# Project Overview

This project is an **Online Store Navigator**, a React application that features a dynamic tree menu, modal dialogs, a content display area, and organized data presentation using accordions.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Chosen for its declarative, component-based architecture and efficient state management, making it ideal for building interactive UIs.
- **Material UI**: Selected for its extensive library of ready-to-use components and theming capabilities, which expedite development and ensure a cohesive design.
- **React Hooks (useState, useEffect)**: Utilized for managing component state and side effects, enabling a functional programming style.

## Design Decisions

### Why React over Vanilla JavaScript:
- **Simplified UI Development**: React's component model makes building complex UIs more manageable.
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Code reusability and easier maintenance through component-based architecture.
- **Efficient Rendering**: Leveraging the virtual DOM for optimized rendering performance.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
